<p><font size="6" color="White" font face="Vera Serif">I grew up with my parents Monica and James Doherty. They were always there for me and my older brother no matter what situation we found ourselves in. I also grew up being very close to all of my cousins. All 32 of them have grown to be some of my best friends. </center></p>
